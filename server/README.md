## Run the application
### In development mode
To run the application in development mode, use the following command. This will start the server using nodemon which helps to restart our server automatically when any file changes. There will be no need to terminate and rerun the app again with every file change.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### In production mode
```
npm start
```
